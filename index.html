								<p>My interests in I.T. stem towards the hardware that makes a computer function like PCB and their functions, to the digital function of software and how they enable user enjoyment and creation through software, and to enable me to understand how I.T. works to allow to make me more efficient in my everyday life. My interests in I.T. occurred after I had built my first computer in primary school, this was sparked from watching YouTube videos on how to build computers. My experience with I.T. has continued through most of my education in high school by me purposely choosing software development and data analytics courses which helped me understand what aspects of I.T. I enjoy the most. <a href="#P">awesome work</a>.</p>
								<p>Continuing my education after high school I have chosen to continue my education at RMIT as I believe it to be the best university for an I.T. based education within Melbourne. </p>
								<p>During my education at RMIT I expect to learn many types of programming and how software can be used to our advantage in a workplace, with most of the basics for each program being explained thoroughly. </p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Product Data Analyst at reecetech requires employees to produce information for improving products and delivering user-based services for customers through the Reece maX app, employees will need to produce large data sets and analyse the work of peers to review one another to produce further insights from data and inform development of a product within the maX application better the experience at the company as a whole, documenting the data assets and collaborating with customers and staff to expand and build data analysis methods. This position is appealing to me as I find data management interesting and enjoy finding the information that can be extracted from data, giving me insights into the data and how it may predict/show events that will allow me to develop more changes for the maX application.</p>
								<p>This position requires that I understand databases, Access software, SQL query, data experience and analytical understanding of data, furthermore reecetech requires that employees have decent experience with working and collaborating with other people within a workplace and working in a collaborative way. </p>
								<p>Skills including UX design and SQL databases and being generally tech savvy, I currently have experience in, I also have had past work opportunities to collaborate with working colleagues and have a previous working understanding of how to graph and transform data into information to create greater meaning within the data, which will also be utilised in the job.</p>
								<p>To acquire the prerequisites needed to understand the workload I plan to continue developing my knowledge within the database realm by learning more advanced SQL programming to better prepare myself for what the position will entail and continue to build upon my collaborative working through working with more people that I have not met before.</p>

								<p>The tests help me understand myself a little bit better in the eyes of others and my strengths, it helps me gauge my weaknesses with socialising and having the constant need to physically do things to enable learning. Which allows me to show that I have strong attributes in patience and thoughtfulness which can be very viable to tackle a company’s technical needs in long term, it highlights how I need the input of a keyboard to keep my mind active during studying which further depicts my need for a I.T. based workload as my future career. </p>
								<p>After viewing the test results, it also helps me identify that I would need to find a workplace that matches my needs to allow for the best workflow. It has also helped me understand that I am a very hands-on person when it comes to education and working, taking pride in my creativity and show my strengths to others. </p>
								<p>These results signify that it may be hard for me to be a team leader and rather a member of the team it would also make me consider the need for, I would act in a more individual manner rather than constantly collaborating with other workers, it also shows that I am good at working with technical work influencing the amount of work I can produce while in a team, being a tactile learner also would influence how I explain things to my team and I would need to have a physical way to demonstrate what I am trying to explain for them and myself to understand. </p>
								<p>When forming a team, I would want others who would support me to allow for exceptional workflow, ones that do not oppose my views in the workforce and those who are of the opposite strengths so that we balance each other out, I would need people who would be able to consider my thoughts and work with them but also critique me when I am wrong and having a strong sense of analysis with their work.</p>
