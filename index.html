								<p>•	Aidyn Lay<img src="images/face.JPG" style = "float: right" alt="My Face" width="120" height="150"><br>•	S3899299<br>•	aidyn.jlay@gmail.com<br>•	Born in Australia, and of East Timorese/Chinese background<br>•	Completed VCE in 2020 and currently studying at RMIT for the bachelor’s degree in Information Technology.<br>•	I enjoy deconstructing video game consoles and collecting video games to have a broad range of video games to play.</p>
<b>Interests </b>
								<p> My interests in I.T. stem towards the components that make a computer function like a CPU and GPU, more specifically I am interested in their performance and the incremental upgrades each year, I am also interested in the digital function of software and how they enable users enjoy a variety of entertainment and creation through just simple button presses, this includes any video game and adobe application. I am also very interested in new types of software that enable me to allow to be more efficient in my everyday life, like digital cards and calendars. My interests in I.T. occurred after I had built my first computer in grade 6 during primary school, this was sparked from watching YouTube videos on how to build computers due to my HP desktop being unable run any games. My experience with I.T. has continued through most of my education in high school in which I would always be nominated by my peers to help the teachers fix their computer when needed, I also purposely choose software development and data analytics courses during high school which helped me understand which aspects of I.T. I enjoy the most. </p>
		<b>Education</b>
								<p>Continuing my education after high school I have chosen to continue my education at RMIT as I believe it to be the best university for an I.T. based education within Melbourne. </p>
								<p>During my education at RMIT I expect to learn many types of programming with most of the basics for each program being explained thoroughly. </p>

								<b>My Ideal Job</b> <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/51787290?type=standout#searchRequestToken=31618462-5084-4887-8822-3e326f0345d8">Reecetech Job</a>
								<p>Product Data Analyst at reecetech requires employees to produce information to
									improve products and deliver user-based services for customers through the Reece maX app, employees will need to produce large data sets and analyse the work of peers and review one another to produce further insights from data and inform development of a product within the maX application to allow for better experience at the company, documenting the data assets and collaborating with customers and staff to expand and build data analysis methods. This position is appealing to me as I find data management interesting and enjoy finding the information that can be extracted from data, giving me insights into the data and how it may predict/show events that will allow me to develop more changes for the maX application.
								</p>
								<b>Skills needed in this Job</b>
								<p>This position requires that I understand databases, Access software, SQL query, data experience and analytical understanding of data, furthermore reecetech requires that employees have decent experience with working and collaborating with other people within a workplace and working in a collaborative way.  </p>
								<b>Skills I have experience with </b>
								<p>Skills including UX design and SQL databases and being generally tech savvy, I currently have experience in, I also have had past work opportunities to collaborate with working colleagues and have a previous working understanding of how to graph and transform data into information to create greater meaning within the data, which will also be utilised in the job.</p>
								<b>How I aim to obtain the skills</b>
								<p>To acquire the prerequisites needed to understand the workload I plan to continue developing my knowledge within the database realm by learning more advanced SQL programming to better prepare myself for what the position will entail and continue to build upon my collaborative working through working with more people that I have not met before.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The tests help me understand myself a little bit better in the eyes of others and my strengths, it helps me gauge my weaknesses with socialising and having the constant need to physically do things to enable learning. Which allows me to show that I have strong attributes in patience and thoughtfulness which can be very viable to tackle a company’s technical needs in long term, it highlights how I need the input of a keyboard to keep my mind active during studying which further depicts my need for a I.T. based workload as my future career. </p>
								<p>After viewing the test results, it also helps me identify that I would need to find a workplace that matches my needs to allow for the best workflow. It has also helped me understand that I am a very hands-on person when it comes to education and working, taking pride in my creativity and show my strengths to others. </p>
								<p>These results signify that it may be hard for me to be a team leader and rather a member of the team it would also make me consider the need for, I would act in a more individual manner rather than constantly collaborating with other workers, it also shows that I am good at working with technical work influencing the amount of work I can produce while in a team, being a tactile learner also would influence how I explain things to my team and I would need to have a physical way to demonstrate what I am trying to explain for them and myself to understand. </p>
								<p>When forming a team, I would want others who would support me to allow for exceptional workflow, ones that do not oppose my views in the workforce and those who are of the opposite strengths so that we balance each other out, I would need people who would be able to consider my thoughts and work with them but also critique me when I am wrong and having a strong sense of analysis with their work.</p>

							<!-- PROJECT IDEAS -->
							<article id="B">
								<h2 class="major">Project idea</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<b> Overview </b>
								<p> My project idea would be a mobile application which centralises all chats from the messaging portion of social media apps this includes Facebook, Instagram, Wechat, Snapchat, Whatsapp etc, with this application it aims to create a one stop place to read and send messages, where an individual can just access all their messages through this singular app to alleviate the need to open multiple applications, it will be a simplified area to access messages in one area to decrease the clutter of having multiple apps.</p>
								<b> Motivation </b>
								<p> My motivation for this project would be due to me wanting to message with only one application rather than needing to have multiple applications open at once, like with moving all types of cards on google pay, I believe that having chats centralised will diminish clutter with the amount of chats and of social medias platforms a user may be using, the fact is that having multiple applications is becoming fatiguing and running multiple at once can be a drain on the battery life and storage of a mobile device, and by having one application do all the messaging it would minimise the phone utilisation and clutter of applications from the phones front menu, solving my issues with battery drain and messy user interfaces caused by large amount of application installs on a device. </p>
								<b> Description </b>
								<p> •	Clean up your cluttered icon spaces and reduce battery usage by using this app.<br> •	This application will allow users to express themselves through their desired social media within a centralised realm, this means that messaging will all be located within this application and allows the user to converse with people faster without the need to open and close multiple applications to simply chat.<br>•	This application will allow users to express themselves through their desired social media within a centralised realm, this means that messaging will all be located within this application and allows the user to converse with people faster without the need to open and close multiple applications to simply chat. <br> •	When utilising this application users will be prompted to login to each social media that they want to unify the chats of, this can be as many as they want and even just one if they have chosen so, however the chats would be opened through a browser-based way. <br>•	When browsing the app each chat should be colour coded and icon highlighted to indicate a chat from a different social media.<br>•	All notifications will be alerted through this application rather than the corresponding social media app and when opened it will navigate to the correct chat that was selected from the notification.<br>•	It will have a hamburger drop down menu by the side of the screen to allow users to select the social media providers and once chosen will show each chat that is associated with that social media.<br>•	There is also a sort function for a-z/z-a and ascending/descending order for each social media title making it easier for the user to find which social media chat they would like to talk in.<br>•	The colours and layout will be minimal and simplistic for the user to understand where each button navigates as well, giving them less visual distraction for where to go.<br>•	Each social media button will have their original application icon and their primary colour to highlight which social media however this can be changed by the user if preferred ultimately to help the user navigate without error and get to their desired chat efficiently.<br>•	When reopening the application, it should continue where the user had left off keeping the previous chat open until the user has chosen to back out into the menu for social media selection.<br>•	The application also allows users to also customise the font size of the texts for better viewability and whether to get notifications from each social media, this will give users greater control of what notifications they want to see from each social media.<br>•	Navigating the application will happen in a horizontal and vertical fashion showing lists of social medias in a rectangular bubble button, each button will have a drop-down menu to customise each social media colour and can be reorganised by holding down on the icon and moving it.<br>•	When a chat is opened it will look identical to respective social medias chat layout and cannot be modified unless the social media provider has allowed their chats to do so. </p>


								<b> Tools and Technologies </b>
								<p> Tools required to create the application would be android studio with java installed on a computer, this is used to code and mock-up designs for how the application will look before running on the phone, android studio is needed as it allows for the program to be made for specifically android devices and not any other mobile based OS, hardware needed would be an android device and a computer that is able to run the android studio and has an output USB port so it can be uploaded to an actual android device, the computer may also need to be running a 64bit operating system to be able to compile the app. </p>
								<b> Skills required </b>
								<p>Skills required to create the program would be programming background knowledge mainly in C language under JavaScript, to gain the skills needed to program the application multiple online courses should suffice in creating a simple user interface and most basic functions like login and chat selection, furthermore some YouTube videos covering the basics of programming an app may be enough to develop a working concept of the application. Feasibility of accessing hardware needed is extremely high as computers and android devices have become common and easy to acquire.  </p>
								<b>Outcome</b>
								<p> if this project was successful, I believe that people would start to minimise multiple apps being installed just for messaging and make them only keep ones for more advanced functions like image posting, not needing to have multiple apps for messaging would also simplify user’s choice of social media and allow them to chat to more people in one area without having to search and find the other application that would normally be used overall reducing clutter on their device and making it more efficient to message, hopefully making more people utilise a single application over multiple. The problem of having multiple apps for messaging will be solved if people commit to using one app to load all their messages and make more individuals want it over wasting precious storage and battery on their mobile device. </p>
